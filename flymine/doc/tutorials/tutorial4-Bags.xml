    <title>Tutorial 4: Bags and History</title>


    <para>All queries in FlyMine can be performed on lists or 'bags'
    that you create yourself. Bags are holders for lists of data,
    e.g. a list of gene identifiers. Saved bags of data can be used to
    constrain queries (either a template query or in the
    QueryBuilder), perform logical operations (union, intersect,
    subtract) and can be exported.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Bags can be created from an external source:
      click on 'Bags' on the top menu bar of any FlyMine page and type
      or past in a list of identifiers, or upload a file containing
      the list.</para></listitem>
 
      <listitem><para>Data from previous queries can also be saved
      into a bag. To save your data to a bag select the required data
      on a result page and either add it to an existing bag or save it
      to a new bag, using the boxes displayed underneath the
      results. Selecting the check boxes next to the column headings
      will select the entire column for saving. Alternatively,
      individual items can be saved by selecting check boxes next to
      the items.</para></listitem>

   </itemizedlist>

      <para>This tutorial will illustrate how to create bags and how
      to make use of bags. As an example, we will search for the
      orthologues of <emphasis>D. melanogaster</emphasis> eye
      specification genes in <emphasis>D. pseudoobscura</emphasis>. We
      will then export the gene sequences for all the orthologues at
      once. To find the orthologues of the
      <emphasis>D. melanogaster</emphasis> genes in
      <emphasis>D. pseudoobscura</emphasis>, we will first make a bag
      of the <emphasis>D. melanogaster</emphasis> genes. Click on
      'Bags' in the top menu bar.</para>

     <para>To make your bag:</para>
 
   <orderedlist>


      
      <listitem><para>You must first decide what type of bag you are
		going to create as it is not possible to create mixed
		bags.  We are going to make a bag of genes, so select
		'Gene' from the drop down list.  You can also
		optionally set the organism for the bag you want to
		create.  This is useful if, for example, you have a
		list of gene symbols, as the same symbol may be
		present in more than one organism.  As we are
		uploading a list of gene symbols from
		<emphasis>D. melanogaster</emphasis>, select tis
		organism from the drop down list. </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Either type or cut and paste in a list of
      identifiers, or upload a list from a file. As an example, type
      in the gene symbols 'eya', 'pax6', 'toy', 'dac' and 'so' into
      the box.</para></listitem>

    

      <listitem><para>Click on 'Create bag' to upload your
      bag.</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="bag-create.png" />
          </imageobject><textobject><phrase> </phrase></textobject>
        </mediaobject>

    <para>When you press 'Create bag' FlyMine will perform a check of
    all the items in your list against the FlyMine database to make
    sure it can find them.  The next page displayed will show you any
    discrepencies that have been found and will allow you to give your
    bag a name and save it.  In this case one of the symbols in our
    list was found only as a synonym in FlyMine - in other words we
    did not have the official gene symbol for that gene (ey) in our
    list.  In this case, this dosn't maatter as it is still the gene
    we want, so we can add this to our list.  See the manual for other
    types of discrepencies that may be reported.</para>

    <para>Once you are happy with the items in your bag, enter a name
    and press 'Save bag'. </para>


        <mediaobject>

          </imageobject><textobject><phrase> </phrase></textobject>
        </mediaobject>


    <para>The next page displayed is a 'Bag details page', which
    provides a summary of the contents of your bag, some widgets
    showing gene expression, pathway and GO term enrichment data
    (where available) and a set of templates that have been
    automatically run on the contents of your bag.</para>

    <para>If you click on 'bags' in the top menu bar you will find
    your saved bag in your MyMine account. If you are logged in this
    will be saved permanently. </para>

    <para>Now we want to find all the orthologous genes in
    <emphasis>D. pseudoobscura</emphasis> using an existing
    template. Find the template 'Gene --> Orthologues in one specific
    organism' (Comparative Genomics aspect).</para>

   <para>Any variable in a template query can be constrained to a bag
    (or 'not in' a bag) rather than a single value, providing you have
    a bag of the correct type saved in your MyMine account. Click on
    the check-box below the Synonym value box to constrain the gene
    synonym value to be in a bag. If you have bags of the correct type
    saved in your 'MyMine' account the option to constrain each
    variable to a bag will appear automatically. The name of the bag
    you just created will appear in the drop-down menu. Select the
    right organisms from the two other drop-down menus and run the
    query.</para>

        </mediaobject>

   <para>The results table shows the
   <emphasis>D. melanogaster</emphasis> genes with their corresponding
   orthologues in <emphasis>D. pseudoobscura</emphasis>. Only 4 out of
   the 5 <emphasis>D. melanogaster</emphasis> genes have orthologues
   in <emphasis>D. pseudoobscura</emphasis>.</para>

    

   <para>Save the orthologous genes in a new bag:</para>
 
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>Click on the check-box in the title of column 4
      which contains the gene symbols for the orthologues. This
      selects all items in the column (on every result page, if more
      than one page). Alternatively, select individual items in the
      column.</para></listitem>

     <listitem><para>At the bottom of the page is an option to save
      the selected results in a new bag. Choose a new bag name
      e.g. 'eye-genes_dpse' and click 'Save'.</para></listitem>

    <para>Bags of data, as well as previously executed queries, can be
    retrieved from your MyMine account page at the top menu bar on any
    FlyMine page (bags can also be directly accessed through the
    'Bags' link). Your bags and query history will remain available to
    you only for the duration of a session unless you create and use a
    login. If you log in (via button on top menu bar), your bags and
    query history can be stored permanently. Click on 'MyMine' in the
    top menu bar.</para>
