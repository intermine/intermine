    <title>The result display</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The results page displays the first 10 objects returned by your
        query.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The number of objects displayed can be changed by changing the
        number in the Page size box and pressing Change.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You can scroll though the objects using Next, or go to the last
        objects using Last.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The total number of objects returned by your query is estimated.
        An estimate is given because, for large queries, only a subset of the
        total number of objects is initially returned by the query. This is to
        improve query run time for large queries.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  <section>
    <title>Saved Queries</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>All queries run are saved in the query history. If you do not
        give your query a particular name (in the 'Save query' box at the
        bottom of the query interface), it will be saved as query_x (where x
        increments for each query run). The name given to your current query
        is displayed at the top of the results page.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>To access your query history, click on History in the menu bar.
        Here you can select a query to run again or modify in the query
        builder interface. You can also delete any queries you no longer wish
        to keep.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Saving bags of data</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Data can be saved into 'bags' and stored in your query history.
        To save your data to a bag select the required data and either add it
        to an existing bag or save it to a new bag. Selecting the check-boxes
        next to the column headings will select the entire column for export.
        Alternatively, individual items can be saved by selecting check-boxes
        next to the items. Saved bags of data can be viewed from the History
        page (accessible form the menu bar).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Saved bags of data can be used to constrain new queries. If you
        have saved bags of data these will become available for constraining
        queries in the constraint list of the query builder page.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Exporting Data</title>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Data can be exported from the results page in various formats -
        currently as comma separated or tab separated files. Both are suitable
        for import into Excel or OpenOffice. By default, the entire data set
        will be exported, regardless of any selected check-boxes. However, if
        you do not wish to export certain columns these can be hidden using
        the 'hide' option in the column header. Note that for further data
        processing it is most useful to export columns containing simple
        values (such as gene names). Other columns containing objects (such as
        genes) will be exported in a human-readable textual representation
        similar to that displayed on the results display.</para>
