0.9605: Sat 12 Mar 2011 21:25:56 EST
        * Added Webservice::InterMine::Simple (see benchmarks)
            There is a compilation penalty inherent in the use of Moose
            and meta-class introspection. While perfectly acceptable 
            when multiple queries are made withing the same process, 
            for the common use case of a single query, the user may wish for
            something more performant. In this case, a script that uses 
            Webservice::InterMine::Simple will gain a full magnitude increase
            in performance (3.5p/s vs 0.33p/s). However, multiple queries
            within the same process do not see a similar improvement, it being
            more in the range of 300% (70p/s vs 250p/s). Where speed is important,
            and more sophisticated features are not required, a Simple service
            may be appealing
         * Added support for headers.
0.9700: Wed 2 June 2011
        * Changed result parsing logic - uses a JSON format internally for all 
          non trivial parsing to ensure safety of field content and diagnostics 
          of errors.
        * Enabled lazy iteration of result sets by default. This improves responsiveness
        for large datasets.
        * Incorporated iteration into queries as a transparent feature.
        * Added list services (creation, deletion, renaming, intersection, unions, differences, subtraction, appending)
        * Added summary methods (show)
        * Added template and query upload methods
0.9701: Sat 4 June 2011
        * Improved template parsing speed by only parsing what is requested
        * Improved show printing format with more appropriate column sizes, and column guides.
0.9702: Sat 4 June 2011
        * Bug-fix release - subclass parsing was broken
0.9702: Sun 5 June 2011
        * Bug-fix release - Fixed handling of empty result sets - added test
