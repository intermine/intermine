        Version of Model library compatible with InterMine 0.94

0.9401  Sun Sep 26 13:54:14 BST 2010
        Descriptors now have overloaded string representation: $_->name

0.9600  Tue Feb 22 18:07:12 GMT 2011
        * ClassDescriptors are now Moose::Meta::Classes too - 
        allowing direct instantiation of their objects.
        * The attributes of instantiated objects are type-safe
0.9601  Wed Feb 23 16:27:05 GMT 2011
        * Weaken is no longer necessary: it causes warnings.
        * Finally activated the boilerplate tests
0.9602  Fri Feb 25 21:00:08 GMT 2011
        * More documentation
        * ClassDescriptor->references no longer includes Collections
        * silenced JSON::Boolean coercion warning with horrible hack
        * Caching and merging of objects based on objectId - true object identity over graphs
        * Basic instantiation prototype now an actual class 
          rather than a bundle of methods (InterMine::Model::Object).
        * Reimplemented some attributes as methods to save memory
        * Weakened some circular references to prevent leaks
0.9603  Mon Feb 28 18:56:16 GMT 2011
        * Made as much as possible immutable.
        * Fixed bug with prevented instantiation of more than one model at a time.
0.9604  Tue Mar  1 11:53:46 GMT 2011
        * Declared incompatibility with Test::More's 2.0 devel series, until 
          subtests are deemed safe again
0.9605  Tue Mar  1 15:12:25 GMT 2011
        * Misunderstanding about how POD is parsed fixed by putting 
          the Model::Handler in its own separate file.
        * Model can now handle more source formats
        * Supplies a TestModel instance to other consuming packages for testing against
0.9606  Thu Mar  3 02:14:48 GMT 2011
        * Models (and their descriptors) can serialise themselves back into xml
        * Added ByIndex to collection get handler to avoid cases where a class has both
          "foo" and "foos". 
0.9607  Thu Mar  3 18:17:20 GMT 2011
        * Provided POD for constants, as some versions of Pod::Coverage demand it
0.9700  This package is now responsible for all its own type definitions.
0.9701  Bug fix
0.9702  Declared required version of MooseX::Role::WithOverloading
0.9801  Finally got boolean fields to get readers prefixed with 'is'. Also, unprefixed accessors for convenience.
0.9802  Dependency bug fix in response to cpantesters report
0.9803  Accept underscores in path names.
0.9900  Added hooks to allow lazily fetching objects to exist, independent of implementation
