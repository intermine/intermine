# This is an automatically generated script to run your query
# to use it you will require the intermine python client.
# To install the client, run the following command from a terminal:
#
#     sudo easy_install intermine
#
# For further documentation you can visit:
#     http://intermine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/web-services/

# The following two lines will be needed in every python script:
from intermine.webservice import Service
service = Service("TEST_SERVICE_ROOT/service")

# Get a new query on the class (table) you will be querying:
query = service.new_query("Gene")

# The view specifies the output columns
query.add_view(
    "primaryIdentifier", "secondaryIdentifier", "symbol", "name",
    "organism.shortName"
)

# Uncomment and edit the line below (the default) to select a custom sort order:
# query.add_sort_order("Gene.primaryIdentifier", "ASC")

# Outer Joins
# (display properties of these relations if they exist,
# but also show objects without these relationships)
query.outerjoin("organism")

for row in query.rows():
    print row["primaryIdentifier"], row["secondaryIdentifier"], row["symbol"], row["name"], \
        row["organism.shortName"]
