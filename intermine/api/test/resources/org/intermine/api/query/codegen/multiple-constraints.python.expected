# This is an automatically generated script to run your query
# to use it you will require the intermine python client.
# To install the client, run the following command from a terminal:
#
#     sudo easy_install intermine
#
# For further documentation you can visit:
#     http://intermine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/web-services/

# The following two lines will be needed in every python script:
from intermine.webservice import Service
service = Service("TEST_SERVICE_ROOT/service")

# Get a new query on the class (table) you will be querying:
query = service.new_query("Employee")

# The view specifies the output columns
query.add_view("name", "department.name")

# You can edit the constraint values below
query.add_constraint("department.manager", "IS NOT", "department.company.CEO", code = "A")
query.add_constraint("Employee", "LOOKUP", "M*", code = "B")
query.add_constraint("department.name", "ONE OF", ["Sales", "Warehouse"], code = "C")

# Your custom constraint logic is specified with the code below:
query.set_logic("(A or C) and B")

for row in query.rows():
    print row["name"], row["department.name"]
