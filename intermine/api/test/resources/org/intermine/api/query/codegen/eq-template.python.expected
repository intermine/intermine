# to use it you will require the intermine python client.
# To install the client, run the following command from a terminal:
#
#     sudo easy_install intermine

# For further documentation you can visit:
#     http://intermine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/web-services/

from intermine.webservice import Service
service = Service("TEST_SERVICE_ROOT/service")

# For all genes, list the taxonIds available.  Used by webservice to construct
# links to other intermines.

template = service.get_template('im_available_organisms')

# You can edit the constraint values below
# A    Gene.primaryIdentifier
