# This is an automatically generated script to run your query
# to use it you will require the intermine python client.
# To install the client, run the following command from a terminal:
#
#     sudo easy_install intermine
#
# For further documentation you can visit:
#     http://intermine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/web-services/

# The following two lines will be needed in every python script:
from intermine.webservice import Service
service = Service("TEST_SERVICE_ROOT/service")

# Get a new query on the class (table) you will be querying:
query = service.new_query("Employee")

# Type constraints should come early - before all mentions of the paths they constrain
query.add_constraint("department.manager", "CEO")

# The view specifies the output columns
query.add_view("name", "age", "department.manager.salary")

for row in query.rows():
    print row["name"], row["age"], row["department.manager.salary"]
