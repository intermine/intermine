    /*
     * This class provides methods for cancelling requests, so here is an explanation of how this
     * magic works.
     *
     * The ObjectStore provides a query cancellation system, where you register your thread as
     * having a request ID, which is any object you choose, and then you run your query as normal.
     * Another thread can come along and pass that request ID to the objectstore, telling it to
     * cancel the associated query. The Thread making the request may throw an exception, and
     * all subsequent actions will throw exceptions until the request ID is deregistered from the
     * ObjectStore.
     *
     * This PrefetchManager messes all of this up, because it uses extra threads to perform
     * queries, so a thread can be waiting in the PrefetchManager for another thread to finish
     * a query. The PrefetchManager maps user threads onto action threads - sometimes they will
     * be the same, but other times they will not.
     *
     * The PrefetchManager works with PrefetchManager.Request objects, which represent a unit of
     * work to perform. These can be used as request ID objects to hand to the ObjectStore. So,
     * Threads should register request ID objects with this PrefetchManager, in the same way as
     * with the ObjectStore. When a cancel request comes in, the PrefetchManager will then be able
     * to match that against a Request object. A request ID matches a PrefetchManager.Request
     * object if a Thread with that request ID is currently inside the PrefetchManager.doRequest()
     * method. There are several scenarios:
     * 1. The thread is doing the work itself, and it is the only one that needs that data.
     *       -> dead simple, just cancel the request.
     * 2. The thread is doing the work itself, but there are other threads waiting for the same
     *    data.
     *       -> Policy decision to be made. Probably cancel the request, and let the other threads
     *          start again.
     * 3. The thread is waiting for another thread to finish the work, and there are no other
     *    threads waiting for the data.
     *       -> In this case, the thread that is doing the work is guaranteed to be a prefetch
     *          thread, so it can just be cancelled.
     * 4. The thread is waiting for another thread to finish the work, but there are other threads
     *    waiting for the same data. Another thread waiting for the data will be any thread that
     *    is inside the doRequest() method with that PrefetchManager.Request object, regardless of
     *    whether that thread has registered a request ID or not.
     *      -> The thread that is doing the work may or may not be a prefetch thread. In either
     *         case, the waiting thread should be kicked out of the doRequest() method without
     *         jeopardising the thread that is performing the work.
