/**
 * This class provides a "shutdown" service to other classes. It sets up a single
 * shutdown hook, which iterates through a series of objects that are registered with it,
 * shutting them down in turn. This class currently supports java.io.Writer,
 * java.io.OutputStream, and ObjectStoreWriterInterMineImpl. It allows objects to be
 * wrapped in a WeakReference, so that the shutdown hook does not preclude those objects
 * from being garbage collected.
 *
 * The objects are shut down in the opposite order to them being added to this ShutdownHook.
 * Therefore, if you register objects to be shut down from the constructor, no object will be
 * shut down before another object that relies on it for its own shutdown.
