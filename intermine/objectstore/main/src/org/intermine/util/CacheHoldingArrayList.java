/**
 * This is an extension of the the ArrayList class, designed to be used by systems that return
 * Lists of data, with extra data that should not be flushed out of a cache until the List is
 * garbage collected.
 *
 * This is used for example in the ObjectStoreItemPathFollowingImpl, when it generates a batch.
 * The objectstore fetches additional useful objects, and stores them in the holder of a
 * CacheHoldingArrayList as well as a cache. The holder them prevents the extra useful objects from
 * being flushed out of the cache until the DataTranslator has finished with the batch.
