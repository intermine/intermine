begin.templates = To enable users to quickly and easily carry out a range of queries, both simple and complex, FlyMine includes a growing library of predefined 'template' queries. Templates provide a description of a predefined query with a form to fill in a number of constraints.
begin.trytemplates = Here are some templates you can try:
begin.bags = Lists of identifiers can be used in queries and can also be analysed (most frequent GO terms, expression data, etc...).
begin.trybags = Have a look at some Lists we've made for you:
begin.createbags = ...or create your own List
begin.querybuilder = Advanced users can use a flexible query interface to construct their own data mining queries.
begin.data = Data are organised by categories named after the type of data they contain. To each category are associated some templates and lists, so it's easy to find what you are looking for.
