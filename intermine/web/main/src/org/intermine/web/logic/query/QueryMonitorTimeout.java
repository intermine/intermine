/**
 * QueryMonitor that cancels a query after a given timeout period. An instance of this method
 * should be created, passed to SessionMethods.runQuery and then services repeatedly by calling
 * the tickle method periodically. The timeout period should be significantly longer than the
 * tickle period (so a little variance in the time between tickle calls won't cause an
 * unwanted timeout). Note that the constructor calls tickle to initialise the timing so you
 * should create this object when you need it (and will immediately tickle it) and not before.<p>
 *
 * The shouldCancelQuery method will return true if the tickle method has not been called in the
 * past n milliseconds where n is set during construction.
