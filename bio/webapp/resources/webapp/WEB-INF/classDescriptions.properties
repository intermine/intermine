They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI). A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron-intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning.

In mitochondria it plays a direct role in the initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication. In the nucleus it is involved in precursor rRNA processing, where it cleaves the internal transcribed spacer 1 between 18S and 5.8S rRNAs.
RNasePRNA=The RNA component of Ribonuclease P (RNase P), a ubiquitous endoribonuclease, found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Its best characterised activity is the generation of mature 5 prime  ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5 prime leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzymes have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous. Helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs.

RRNA58S=5.8S ribosomal RNA (5.8S rRNA) is a component of the large subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome. It is transcribed by RNA polymerase I as part of the 45S precursor that also contains 18S and 28S rRNA. Functionally, it is thought that 5.8S rRNA may be involved in ribosome translocation. It is also known to form covalent linkage to the p53 tumour suppressor protein. 5.8S rRNA is also found in archaea.
RRNA5S=5S ribosomal RNA (5S rRNA) is a component of the large ribosomal subunit in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, it is synthesised by RNA polymerase III (the other eukaryotic rRNAs are cleaved from a 45S precursor synthesised by RNA polymerase I). In Xenopus oocytes, it has been shown that fingers 4-7 of the nine-zinc finger transcription factor TFIIIA can bind to the central region of 5S RNA. Thus, in addition to positively regulating 5S rRNA transcription, TFIIIA also stabilises 5S rRNA until it is required for transcription.

SmallRegulatoryNcRNA=A non-coding RNA, usually with a specific secondary structure, that acts to regulate gene expression.
SnoRNA=Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in the processing and modification of rRNA in the nucleolus. There are two main classes of snoRNAs: the box C/D class, and the box H/ACA class. U3 snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed, the box C/D element is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3 snoRNAs, namely boxes A, A', B, C, C', and D. The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localization, stability and hypermethylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA.

The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most eubacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures, with eight helical elements. These fold into the Alu and S domains, separated by a long linker region. Eubacterial SRP is generally a simpler structure, with the M domain of Ffh bound to a region of the 4.5S RNA that corresponds to helix 8 of the eukaryotic and archaeal SRP S domain. Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis), however, have a larger SRP RNA that also has an Alu domain. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54/Ffh M domain mediates signal sequence recognition. In eukaryotes and archaea, the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilizes helix 8 for SRP54 binding.

TilingPathFragment=A piece of sequence that makes up a tiling_path (SO:0000472.).
TmRNA=tmRNA liberates a mRNA from a stalled ribosome. To accomplish this part of the tmRNA is used as a reading frame that ends in a translation stop signal. The broken mRNA is replaced in the ribosome by the tmRNA and translation of the tmRNA leads to addition of a proteolysis tag to the incomplete protein enabling recognition by a protease. Recently a number of permuted tmRNAs genes have been found encoded in two parts. tmRNAs have been identified in eubacteria and some chloroplasts but are absent from archeal and eukaryote nuclear genomes.

TransSpliceAcceptorSite=The process that produces mature transcripts by combining exons of independent pre-mRNA molecules. The acceptor site lies on the 3' of these molecules
TRNA=Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are approximately 80 nucleotides in length. Their secondary structure includes four short double-helical elements and three loops (D, anti-codon, and T loops). Further hydrogen bonds mediate the characteristic L-shaped molecular structure. tRNAs have two regions of fundamental functional importance: the anti-codon, which is responsible for specific mRNA codon recognition, and the 3' end, to which the tRNA's corresponding amino acid is attached (by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases). tRNAs cope with the degeneracy of the genetic code in two manners: having more than one tRNA (with a specific anti-codon) for a particular amino acid; and 'wobble' base-pairing, i.e. permitting non-standard base-pairing at the 3rd anti-codon position.
U11SnRNA=U11 snRNA plays a role in splicing of the minor U12-dependent class of eukaryotic nuclear introns, similar to U1 snRNA in the major class spliceosome it base pairs to the conserved 5' splice site sequence.
U12SnRNA=The U12 small nuclear (snRNA), together with U4atac/U6atac, U5, and U11 snRNAs and associated proteins, forms a spliceosome that cleaves a divergent class of low-abundance pre-mRNA introns.
U14SnRNA=U14 small nucleolar RNA (U14 snoRNA) is required for early cleavages of eukaryotic precursor rRNAs. In yeasts, this molecule possess a stem-loop region (known as the Y-domain) which is essential for function. A similar structure, but with a different consensus sequence, is found in plants, but is absent in vertebrates.
U1SnRNA=U1 is a small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the spliceosome (involved in pre-mRNA splicing). Its 5' end forms complementary base pairs with the 5' splice junction, thus defining the 5' donor site of an intron. There are significant differences in sequence and secondary structure between metazoan and yeast U1 snRNAs, the latter being much longer (568 nucleotides as compared to 164 nucleotides in human). Nevertheless, secondary structure predictions suggest that all U1 snRNAs share a 'common core' consisting of helices I, II, the proximal region of III, and IV.
U2SnRNA=U2 is a small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the spliceosome (involved in pre-mRNA splicing). Complementary binding between U2 snRNA (in an area lying towards the 5' end but 3' to hairpin I) and the branchpoint sequence (BPS) of the intron results in the bulging out of an unpaired adenine, on the BPS, which initiates a nucleophilic attack at the intronic 5' splice site, thus starting the first of two transesterification reactions that mediate splicing.
U4atacSnRNA=An snRNA required for the splicing of the minor U12-dependent class of eukaryotic nuclear introns. It forms a base paired complex with U6atac_snRNA (SO:0000397).
U4SnRNA=U4 small nuclear RNA (U4 snRNA) is a component of the major U2-dependent spliceosome. It forms a duplex with U6, and with each splicing round, it is displaced from U6 (and the spliceosome) in an ATP-dependent manner, allowing U6 to refold and create the active site for splicing catalysis. A recycling process involving protein Prp24 re-anneals U4 and U6.
U5SnRNA=U5 RNA is a component of both types of known spliceosome. The precise function of this molecule is unknown, though it is known that the 5' loop is required for splice site selection and p220 binding, and that both the 3' stem-loop and the Sm site are important for Sm protein binding and cap methylation.
U6atacSnRNA=U6atac_snRNA -An snRNA required for the splicing of the minor U12-dependent class of eukaryotic nuclear introns. It forms a base paired complex with U4atac_snRNA (SO:0000394).
U6SnRNA=U6 snRNA is a component of the spliceosome which is involved in splicing pre-mRNA. The putative secondary structure consensus base pairing is confined to a short 5' stem loop, but U6 snRNA is thought to form extensive base-pair interactions with U4 snRNA.
UTR=Messenger RNA sequences that are untranslated and lie five prime and  three prime to  sequences which are translated.
VaultRNA=A family of RNAs are found as part of the enigmatic vault ribonuceoprotein complex. The complex consists of a major vault protein (MVP), two minor vault proteins (VPARP and TEP1), and several small untranslated RNA molecules. It has been suggested that the vault complex is involved in drug resistance.
VirtualSequence=A continous piece of sequence similar to the 'virtual contig' concept of ensembl.
YRNA=Y RNAs are components of the Ro ribonucleoprotein particle (Ro RNP), in association with Ro60 and La proteins. The Y RNAs and Ro60 and La proteins are well conserved, but the function of the Ro RNP is not known. In humans the RNA component can be one of four small RNAs: hY1, hY3, hY4 and hY5. These small RNAs are predicted to fold into a conserved secondary structure containing three stem structures. The largest of the four, hY1, contains an additional hairpin.

ProteinInteractionExperiment=The description of a particular protein interaction experiment.
ProteinInteractionRegion= The region of a protein molecule that binds to another protein molecule.
ProteinInteractionTerm=A term from the PSI-MI protein interaction ontolgy.
ProteinInteractor=A term for a protein involved in a protein interaction.
ProteinRegion=Amino acid sequence of part of a protein.
ProteinStructure=The three-dimensional conformation of a protein.
Protocol=Documentation of the set of steps taken in a procedure.
Publication=A journal article, book etc.
RankedRelation=A relation that is part of an ordered set of relations. eg. the relationship between transcripts and exons.
Relation=Any relationship between two BioEntities. A relation object has a subject BioEntity and an object BioEntity.
Reporter=The nucleotide sequence present in a particular location on the array
ReversePrimer=A single stranded oligo used for polymerase chain reaction.
RNAiExperiment=The description of a particular RNAi experiment.
RNAiResult=The result from an RNAi screen. This can be either a defined phenotype as a result from an in vivo screen (RNAiPhenotype) or a result from a screen done in cell culture (RNAiScreenHit).
RNAiScreenHit=One experimental result from an RNAi screen (not necessarily a defined phenotype). Currently this is a result from one of the D. melanogaster RNAi screens done in cell-culture. 
Sample=Description of the source of biological material. Can include information on such properties as species, developmental stage, organism part, gender and cell type.
SampleCharacteristic=Description of some characteristic (type and value) of a sample.
Scaffold=Larger sequence contigs that result from the assembly of shorter (often whole genome shotgun, WGS) sequencing reads which could not yet be assembled into chromosomes. Generally, more genome sequencing, narrowing of gaps and establishment of a tiling path is neccessary before a chromosome assembly can be established.
Sequence=The order of building blocks in biological macromolecules like DNA, RNA, protein and polysaccharides.
SimpleRelation=A simple relationship between two BioEntities.
SymmetricalRelation=A relationship between two BioEntities that doesn't have direction - all objects are related to each other in the same way.
Synonym=Another name by which a BioEntity is known.
TilingPathSpan=A tiling path is a set of regions which overlap with minimal polymorphism to form a linear sequence. A TilingPathSpan starts at the initiation codon of one gene and ends at the initiation codon of a neigbouring gene or at a transposable element.
Translation=A possible translation of (part of) a gene that differs from the amino acid sequence found in the corresponding wildtype protein.
Treatment=A treatment is the process or action applied to a particular sample.
TreatmentParameter=A variable within the treatment.
Vector=A DNA molecule that can be used to transfer DNA molecules between organisms.

Protein.primaryAccession=Uniprot primary accession. See 'Synonyms' for other names and identifiers \
for this protein.
Protein.identifier=Uniprot entry name (for example 18C_DROME).  See 'Synonyms' for other names and \
identifiers for this protein.

Gene.allGoAnnotation=For a particular GO term, this provides that GO term and all the parent terms for that GO term.

Gene.length=Genomic length of the gene, i.e. sequences of all introns and exons.

FlyAtlasResult.affyCall=Reflects an up- or down-regulation (or no change at all) compared to the whole fly.

FlyAtlasResult.enrichment=This factor tells you how much higher the signal is in a particular tissue than in the whole fly, i.e. whether the gene is tissue-specific. 

FlyAtlasResult.MRNASignal=Abundance of the mRNA. FlyAtlas considers values over 100 as being abundant, and anything over 1000 as remarkable.

FlyAtlasResult.MRNASignalSEM= The SEM value tells you how consistent or variable the MRNASignal is.

FlyAtlasResult.presentCall=How many of the four arrays for each sample actually gave a detectable expression, according to Affymetrix's GCOS software. 

RNAiScreenHit.maxOffTargetOverlaps=The maximum continuous sequence overlap of potential off-target(s).

RNAiScreenHit.numOffTargets=The number of potential off-targets based on sequence matches: at least one length of 19 bp or more with matching sequence of 19 bp or more of this amplicon.

GOAnnotation.evidenceCode=Every GO annotation must indicate the type of evidence that supports it. \
