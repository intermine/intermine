*FIELD* TX

DESCRIPTION

Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase is a flavoprotein that donates electrons
to all microsomal P450 enzymes, including the steroidogenic enzymes
P450c17 (CYP17A1; 609300), P450c21 (CYP21A2; 613815), and CYP51A1
(601637) (Miller, 1986).

CLONING

Shephard et al. (1989) isolated and sequenced cDNA clones that code for
rat and human NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase.

MAPPING

By Southern blot analysis of DNA isolated from a panel of 8 independent
human-rodent somatic cell hybrids, Shephard et al. (1989) determined
that cytochrome P450 reductase is encoded by a single gene located on
7pter-q22. By in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes, they
refined the localization to 7q11.2.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia due to Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase
Deficiency

Apparent combined P450C17 and P450C21 deficiency (see 613571) is a rare
variant of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, first reported by Peterson et
al. (1985). Affected girls are born with ambiguous genitalia, indicating
intrauterine androgen excess. After birth, however, virilization does
not progress and amounts of circulating androgens are low or normal.
Affected boys are sometimes born undermasculinized. Boys and girls can
also present with bone malformations. Findings of biochemical
investigations of urinary steroid excretion in affected patients have
shown accumulation of steroid metabolites, indicating impaired C17 and
C21 hydroxylation, suggesting concurrent partial deficiencies of the 2
steroidogenic enzymes, P450C17 and P450C21. However, sequencing of the
genes encoding these enzymes showed no mutations, which accorded with
the idea of a defect in a cofactor that interacts with both enzymes.

Arlt et al. (2004) investigated the underlying molecular basis of
congenital adrenal hyperplasia with apparent combined P450C17 and
P450C21 deficiency in 3 affected children, a brother and sister and a
third unrelated patient. All 3 patients were compound heterozygotes for
mutations in the POR gene (see 124015.0005 and 124015.0007-124015.0009),
whereas their parents and an unaffected sib were heterozygotes. One
patient (see 124015.0007) had mild bone abnormalities suggesting
Antley-Bixler syndrome.

In a 23-year-old 46,XX Brazilian female with normal breast development,
primary amenorrhea, and mild arterial hypertension, but no dysmorphic
features, Fluck et al. (2004) detected compound heterozygosity for
mutations in the POR gene (see 124015.0003).

- Antley-Bixler Syndrome with Disordered Steroidogenesis

In 4 unrelated patients with disordered steroidogenesis including 3
children with bony features of Antley-Bixler syndrome, Fluck et al.
(2004) found mutations in the POR gene. This was somewhat surprising
since the affected individuals lacked apparent disorders of bile acid
synthesis or drug metabolism, which also requires P450 enzymes, and
knockout of POR is embryonically lethal in mice (Shen et al., 2002; Otto
et al., 2003).

Huang et al. (2005) sequenced the POR gene in 32 individuals with
Antley-Bixler syndrome and/or hormonal changes that suggested POR
deficiency (201750). Fifteen patients carried POR mutations on both
alleles; 4 carried mutations on only 1 allele. The 34 affected POR
alleles included 10 with ala287-to-pro (124015.0002), all from whites,
and 7 with arg457-to-his (R457H; 124015.0005), including 4 Japanese, 1
African, and 2 Caucasians; 17 of the 34 carried 16 'private' mutations,
including 9 missense and 7 frameshift mutations. One of the patients
with an Antley-Bixler syndrome-like skeletal phenotype and abnormal
steroids and genitalia, in whom Huang et al. (2005) identified compound
heterozygosity for a frameshift and a missense mutation in the POR gene
(see 124015.0015 and 124015.0016, respectively), was the patient in whom
Hurley et al. (2004) had previously found a heterozygous missense
mutation of unclear significance in the FGFR1 gene (136350.0011). Huang
et al. (2005) recreated these 11 missense mutations, plus 10 others
found in databases or reported elsewhere, by site-directed mutagenesis
and assessed them by 4 assays: assays that were based on cytochrome c,
which is not a physiologic substrate for POR, correlated fully with
clinical phenotype, but assays that were based on POR's support of
catalysis by P450c17 (the enzyme most closely associated with the
hormonal phenotype) provided an excellent genotype/phenotype
correlation. Huang et al. (2005) concluded that individuals with an ABS
phenotype and normal steroidogenesis have FGFR mutations, whereas those
with ambiguous genitalia and disordered steroidogenesis should be
recognized as having a distinct new disease: POR deficiency. The
existence of 2 distinct disorders was first suggested by Reardon et al.
(2000).

Fukami et al. (2005) reported molecular and genetic findings in 10
Japanese patients from 8 families with skeletal findings of ABS and
abnormal genitalia and/or impaired steroidogenesis. POR mutations were
identified in 15 of 16 alleles from the 8 families; the R457H mutation
was found in 10 of 16 alleles and was associated with a specific
haplotype. Fukami et al. (2005) suggested that the high frequency of
R457H in the Japanese is due to a founder effect. Four other mutations
were also identified in these patients: a 1-bp insertion (124015.0011),
a 24-bp deletion (124015.0012), a missense mutation (Y578C;
124015.0013), and a silent 15A-G transition (G5G; 124015.0014).

ANIMAL MODEL

Otto et al. (2003) found that deletion of the Cpr gene in mice resulted
in death in early to middle gestation. Cpr -/- embryos exhibited
multiple abnormalities, including severe inhibition of vasculogenesis
and hematopoiesis and defects in brain and limb development. Some of the
abnormalities could be attributed to perturbations in retinoic acid
homeostasis. Embryos at 9.5 days postcoitum had significantly elevated
levels of retinoic acid and reduced levels of retinol. Furthermore, some
of the phenotypes could be either reversed or exacerbated by decreasing
or increasing maternal retinoic acid exposure, respectively.

ANTLEY-BIXLER SYNDROME WITH GENITAL ANOMALIES AND DISORDERED STEROIDOGENESIS
POR, VAL492GLU

In a child with bony features of Antley-Bixler syndrome and disordered
steroidogenesis (201750), Fluck et al. (2004) found heterozygosity for a
transversion in the POR gene, 1475T-A, leading to the amino acid
substitution val492 to glu (V492E). The mutation was inherited from the
mother, who was heterozygous; no mutation in the exons or first 50
basepairs of splice donor-acceptor sites on the paternal allele was
found.

.0002
ANTLEY-BIXLER SYNDROME WITH GENITAL ANOMALIES AND DISORDERED STEROIDOGENESIS
POR, ALA287PRO

In a child with bony features of Antley-Bixler syndrome with genital
ambiguity and abnormal steroidogenesis (201750), Fluck et al. (2004)
found apparent homozygosity for a nucleotide substitution 859G-C in the
POR gene leading to an ala287-to-pro (A287P) substitution. This child
had been described by Kelley et al. (2002). The mother was heterozygous
for the mutation; paternal DNA was not available.

Huang et al. (2005) sequenced the POR gene in 29 individuals with
Antley-Bixler syndrome and/or hormonal findings that suggested POR
deficiency. Fifteen patients carried POR mutations on both alleles; 4
carried mutations on only 1 allele. The 34 affected POR alleles included
10 with A287P, all in Caucasians.

DISORDERED STEROIDOGENESIS DUE TO CYTOCHROME P450 OXIDOREDUCTASE DEFICIENCY
POR, CYS569TYR

In a phenotypically normal woman with amenorrhea and disordered
steroidogenesis (613571), Fluck et al. (2004) found compound
heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the POR gene, 1706G-A and 1822G-T,
leading to the amino acid substitutions cys569 to tyr (C569Y) and val608
to phe (V608F; 124015.0004), respectively. Parental DNA was not
available.

POR, ARG457HIS

In a child with Antley-Bixler syndrome and disordered steroidogenesis
(201750), Fluck et al. (2004) found compound heterozygosity for a
1370G-A transition in the POR gene leading to an arg457-to-his (R457H)
substitution on the maternal allele, and a 731+1G-A change (124015.0006)
in the first base of the splice donor site of intron 6 on the paternal
allele. The corresponding minigene construct retained intron 6, leading
to a premature stop codon.

In a female (46,XX) offspring of healthy, unrelated parents of Polish
descent with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to apparent combined
deficiency of P450C17 and P450C21 (613571), Arlt et al. (2004) described
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the POR gene: an 849G-C
transversion in exon 8 resulting in ala284-to-pro (A284P; 124015.0009)
substitution, and the R457H mutation. (The authors, using the rat
nomenclature, designated this mutation R454H.) The girl was born with
clubfeet and ambiguous genitalia, including enlargement of the clitoris
and partial labial fusion. Virilization did not progress after birth.
Follow-up at 13 years of age showed a marfanoid habitus, scoliosis,
arachnodactyly, dysplastic ears, and long, slim limbs. Ovarectomy due to
rupture of large ovarian cysts was performed at 14 and 16 years of age.
In this family, 5 preceding and 2 subsequent pregnancies resulted in
early miscarriages. The unaffected father was heterozygous for A284P;
the unaffected mother and younger brother were heterozygous for R457H.

Huang et al. (2005) sequenced the POR gene in 29 individuals with a
diagnosis of Antley-Bixler syndrome and/or hormonal findings that
suggested POR deficiency. Fifteen patients carried POR mutations on both
alleles, and 4 carried mutations on only 1 allele. The 34 affected POR
alleles included 7 with R457H, in 4 Japanese, 1 African, and 2 white
patients.

Fukami et al. (2005) identified the R457H mutation in 10 of 16 alleles
from 8 Japanese families with skeletal findings of ABS and abnormal
genitalia and/or impaired steroidogenesis. R457H was associated with a
specific haplotype; Fukami et al. (2005) suggested that the high
frequency of R457H in the Japanese is due to a founder effect.

Adachi et al. (2006) performed SNP analysis in 5 previously reported
patients with POR deficiency and the R457H mutation (4 Japanese and 1
Polish), and found that the non-Japanese patient had the same SNP
pattern as Japanese patients, suggesting that R457H is a global founder
mutation.

DISORDERED STEROIDOGENESIS DUE TO CYTOCHROME P450 OXIDOREDUCTASE DEFICIENCY
POR, TYR178ASP 

In a brother and sister with congenital adrenal hyperplasia associated
with apparent combined P450C17 and P450C21 deficiency (613571), Arlt et
al. (2004) found compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the POR
gene: a 531T-G transversion in exon 5, resulting in tyr178 to asp
(Y178D), and a 1696G-A transition in exon 13, resulting in cys566 to tyr
(C566Y; 124015.0008). The girl was born with ambiguous genitalia;
ultrasound examination showed the presence of a uterus and ovaries, and
the karyotype was confirmed as 46,XX. In addition, she had a broad nasal
bridge and ulnar deviation of the wrists with brachytelephalangia and
flattened metacarpal epiphyses, features resembling those of
Antley-Bixler syndrome (see 207410). Virilization did not progress after
birth. In the case of the younger brother, the mother's urinary steroid
excretion was monitored longitudinally during pregnancy. Her estriol
concentration failed to rise, and androsterone excretion rose, peaking
around 20 weeks' gestation. Signs of virilization (acne, hirsutism)
developed in the mother by 23 weeks' gestation. The mother's
hyperandrogenism resolved rapidly after birth. The boy's karyotype was
46,XY and he had normal male genitalia, including descended testes, at
birth. There was no evidence of skeletal abnormalities. The unaffected
parents were heterozygous for Y178D and C566Y, respectively.

ANTLEY-BIXLER SYNDROME WITH GENITAL ANOMALIES AND DISORDERED STEROIDOGENESIS
POR, 1-BP INS, 1329C  

In 2 Japanese sibs and an unrelated Japanese individual with skeletal
findings of Antley-Bixler syndrome and abnormal genitalia and/or
impaired steroidogenesis (201750), Fukami et al. (2005) identified
compound heterozygosity for mutations in the POR gene, one of which was
a 1-bp insertion (1329C) in exon 11, resulting in a truncated protein at
codon 449. On the other allele, the 2 sibs had a 1733A-G transition in
exon 13, resulting in a tyr578-to-cys substitution (Y578C; 124015.0012);
the third patient had an R457H mutation in exon 11 (124015.0005).

In 2 Japanese sibs with skeletal findings of Antley-Bixler syndrome and
abnormal genitalia (201750), Fukami et al. (2005) identified compound
heterozygosity for a 24-bp deletion in exon 14 of the POR gene,
resulting in the loss of 9 amino acids and the creation of 1 amino acid
(arg612), and an R457H mutation in exon 11 (124015.0005).

In a Japanese boy with skeletal findings of Antley-Bixler syndrome and
abnormal genitalia (201750), Fukami et al. (2005) identified compound
heterozygosity for a 15A-G transition in exon 1 of the POR gene,
resulting in a 'silent' gly5-to-gly (G5G) substitution, and an R457H
mutation in exon 11 (124015.0005). Computerized modeling analysis
indicated that the 15A-G transition could disturb an exonic splicing
enhancer motif.

ANTLEY-BIXLER SYNDROME WITH GENITAL ANOMALIES AND DISORDERED STEROIDOGENESIS
POR, 13-BP INS, NT580

In a male infant with skeletal findings of Antley-Bixler syndrome and
abnormal steroids and genitalia (201750), in whom Hurley et al. (2004)
had previously found a heterozygous missense mutation of unclear
significance in the FGFR1 gene (136350.0011), Huang et al. (2005)
identified compound heterozygosity for a 13-bp insertion
(580insTACGTGGACAAGC) and a gly539-to-arg (G539R; 124015.0016)
substitution in the POR gene. The frameshift was predicted to disrupt
the flavin mononucleotide (FMN)- and NADPH-binding sites and to result
in premature termination of the protein. Functional studies showed that
the G539R mutant retained 46% of the 17-alpha-hydroxylase activity but
only 8% of the 17,20 lyase activity; consistent with this, the patient
was able to synthesize cortisol adequately (17-alpha-hydrolase activity)
but had poor production of sex steroids (17,20 lyase activity).

See 124015.0015 and Huang et al. (2005).

Hershkovitz et al. (2008) reported 4 undervirilized males of an extended
Bedouin family. One of these had been reported by Biason-Lauber et al.
(1997) to carry mutations in the CYP17A1 gene (609300), encoding
P450c17, causing isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency (202110). Gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) urinary steroid profiling and
serum steroid measurements showed combined deficiencies of 17,20-lyase
and 21-hydroxylase. Sequencing of exons 1 and 8 of CYP17A1 in 2
different laboratories showed no mutations. Sequencing of the POR gene
showed that all 4 patients were homozygous for G539R, which was shown by
Huang et al. (2005) to retain 46% of normal 17-alpha-hydroxylase
activity but only 8% of the 17,20-lyase activity of P450c17. Hershkovitz
et al. (2008) concluded that POR deficiency (613571) can masquerade
clinically as isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency.

caused by mutation in the gene encoding steroid 17-monooxygenase
(CYP17A1; 609300). The enzyme has both 17-alpha-hydroxylase and
17,20-lyase activities.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Deficiency of adrenal 17-hydroxylation activity was first demonstrated
in a single patient by Biglieri et al. (1966), who suggested a similar
defect in the gonad. Production of excessive corticosterone and
deoxycorticosterone resulted in hypertension and hypokalemic alkalosis.
Aldosterone synthesis was almost totally absent. The patient had normal
stature and amenorrhea. Although there were no other cases in the family
and parental consanguinity was not noted, recessive inheritance was
possible. Biglieri (1997) reviewed the evolution of the clinical
features and laboratory findings in this case over 3 years.

Goldsmith et al. (1967) reported a second case in whom the defect in
17-alpha-hydroxylation may have been less complete than in the first
case. The patient was a 26-year-old woman with hypertension, primary
amenorrhea, and lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Mallin (1969)
described congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17-hydroxylase
deficiency in 2 sisters. New (1970) reported the first affected male.
The clinical features were pseudohermaphroditism with ambiguous external
genitalia and prominent breast development at puberty. Unlike the
previously reported female cases, this male patient did not demonstrate
severe hypertension or hypokalemia. Testicular feminization was
simulated in a patient reported by Heremans et al. (1976).

Yazaki et al. (1982) reported a Japanese phenotypic female, born of
consanguineous parents, with generalized muscle weakness due to
hypokalemic myopathy, primary amenorrhea, and lack of pubertal
development. Laparoscopy showed intraabdominal testes and no uterus.
Karyotype was 46,XY. Laboratory studies showed increased plasma
progesterone, corticosterone, aldosterone, ACTH (see 176830), LH (see
152780), and FSH (see 136530). Glucocorticoid replacement normalized
plasma levels of ACTH, 17-deoxysteroids, and potassium. This patient was
later found to have a homozygous mutation in the CYP17A1 gene
(609300.0011; Yamaguchi et al., 1997), consistent with combined complete
17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency.

Scaroni et al. (1991) reported a family in which 3 members, 2 adult
females and 1 pubertal-aged genotypic male, had congenital adrenal
hyperplasia due to 17-alpha hydroxylase deficiency. All presented as
phenotypic females with lack of sexual development and hypokalemic
hypertension. Baseline hormonal studies showed low glucocorticoid,
androgen, and estrogen levels. As a consequence, ACTH, LH, and FSH
concentrations were increased. Plasma renin and aldosterone were also
decreased. Short-term dexamethasone treatment normalized potassium and
reduced blood pressure and the abnormal mineralocorticoid levels.

Martin et al. (2003) reported 11 patients from 6 Brazilian families with
combined 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency. All patients had
elevated basal serum levels of progesterone and suppressed plasma renin
activity. The authors concluded that basal progesterone measurement is a
useful marker of P450c17 deficiency and that its use should reduce the
misdiagnosis of this deficiency in patients presenting with male
pseudohermaphroditism, primary or secondary amenorrhea, and
mineralocorticoid excess syndrome.

- Combined Partial 17-alpha-Hydroxylase/17,20-Lyase Deficiency

Oshiro et al. (1995) reported a 32-year-old Japanese woman with combined
partial 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency caused by mutation
in the CYP17A1 gene (609300.0008). The patient was referred because of
hypertension and amenorrhea. She had menarche at the age of 14 years
with irregular menstruation until the age of 20, but no menstruation
thereafter. Hypertension had been known since the age of 20 years. She
had a flat chest, infantile genitalia, and no pubic or axillary hair.
Computed tomography revealed bilateral adrenal hyperplasia without
tumors, uterine hypoplasia, and atrophy of the ovaries. The patient had
hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and positive Trousseau sign.

Yanase et al. (1989) reported a Japanese woman with combined partial
17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency caused by mutation in the
CYP17A1 gene (609300.0002). Functional expression studies showed that
17-alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities were less than 37% and
8% of normal, respectively. On a visit to the hospital at the age of 20
because of occipital headache, the patient was found to have
hypertension and hypokalemia. Menstruation was irregular. Physical
examination showed hypoplastic breasts and no pubic or axillary hair.
Miura et al. (1996) reported follow-up of the Japanese woman reported by
Yanase et al. (1989). In 1968, she was reported as having
glucocorticoid-responsive hyperaldosteronism. She was treated with
dexamethasone, resulting in normal blood pressure and normokalemia for
28 years. Because of sustained vaginal bleeding, she had a total
hysterectomy at age 42. No follicles or corpus luteum were detected in
the ovarian specimen. At age 45 years, she had decreased levels of sex
steroids and increased levels of gonadotropins. Miura et al. (1996)
concluded that the disorder resulted in early reduction of gonadal
function with increasing age.

- Isolated 17,20-Lyase Deficiency 

Geller et al. (1997) reported 2 patients with isolated 17,20-lyase
deficiency caused by different homozygous mutations in the CYP17A1 gene
(609300.00012 and 609300.0013, respectively). The first patient had
genital ambiguity at birth, but was assigned female gender. When seen at
13 months of age, the patient showed a 2.2-cm phallus, perineal
hypospadias, bilateral gonads palpable in a bifid scrotum, and a blind
vaginal pouch seen on urethrocystograms. The parents were first cousins.
Serum cortisol and electrolytes and blood pressure were normal.
Gonadotropins were at normal prepubertal level in this patient.
Testicular stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin elicited
grossly subnormal responses of testosterone, DHEA, and androstenedione.
Basal and hCG-stimulated progesterone was normal. The second patient had
a 46,XY karyotype, but genital ambiguity at birth when male gender was
assigned. Gynecomastia developed at 14 years of age, and at 16 years the
breasts were Tanner stage V; pubic hair was Tanner stage IV, but there
was minimal body hair. The genitalia were characterized by a 4.5-cm
phallus, perineal hypospadias, bifid scrotum, small descended testis on
the right and left in the inguinal canal, and a blind vaginal pouch
detected by urethrocystography. The parents denied consanguinity.

Biason-Lauber et al. (1997) reported a newborn male patient from Israel
with micropenis, undescended testes, and a hormonal pattern consistent
with isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency. They found compound heterozygosity
for mutations in the CYP17A1 gene. Gupta et al. (2001) studied one of
the mutations and was unable to demonstrate activity consistent with the
diagnosis. Hershkovitz et al. (2008) restudied this patient along with 3
other affected male relatives. They found deficiency of cytochrome P450
oxidoreductase (POR) caused by homozygosity for a mutation in the POR
gene (124015.0016) in these individuals. Sequencing of the CYP17A1 in 2
different laboratories failed to find the mutations reported by
Biason-Lauber et al. (1997). Hershkovitz et al. (2008) concluded that
POR deficiency (201750) can masquerade clinically as isolated
17,20-lyase deficiency.

MAPPING

Mantero et al. (1980) found no evidence of linkage between HLA and
17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. D'Armiento et al. (1983) demonstrated
that, like 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency (202010), 17-alpha-hydroxylase
deficiency is not linked to HLA.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a patient with combined 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency,
Kagimoto et al. (1988) identified a 4-base duplication in the CYP17A1
gene (609300.0001), resulting in the loss of both enzymatic activities.

In 2 patients with isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency from a small village
in Brazil, Geller et al. (1997) identified 2 different homozygous
mutations in the CYP17A1 gene (609300.0012; 609300.0013). When expressed
in COS-1 cells, the mutants retained 17-alpha-hydroxylase activity, but
had minimal 17,20-lyase activity.

Yanase et al. (1991) stated that since the first description by Biglieri
et al. (1966), at least 122 cases of 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency had
been reported. Furthermore, 14 cases of 17,20-lyase deficiency had been
reported in which 17-alpha-hydroxylase activity remained normal, this
being a major reason that the 2 enzymes were long thought to be
different. Yanase et al. (1991) reviewed 8 cases in which intragenic
lesions had been identified.

In 11 patients from 6 Brazilian families with combined
17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, Martin et al. (2003)
identified mutations in the CYP17A1 gene (609300.0009;
609300.0023-609300.0026).
