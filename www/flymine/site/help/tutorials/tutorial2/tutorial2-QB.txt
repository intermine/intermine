<h1 id="start">Tutorial 2: Using the QueryBuilder and building a template query.</h1>

      <p><i>This tutorial introduces the use of the QueryBuilder by
      altering a template query. It will then show you how to save
      this query as a template.</i></p>

    <p>You can use the QueryBuilder:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>to construct your own data mining queries
      across the multiple integrated data sources,</p></li>

        <li><p>to modify existing template queries or</p></li>

        <li><p>to create your own template queries.</p></li>
      </ul>

<h1>2. The Query Builder Interface</h1>


      <p>The QueryBuilder interface enables you to browse through
    classes and fields of the data model, selecting those that you
    wish to constrain and those that you wish to include in your
    results.  We will begin the tutorial with an overview of the
    QueryBuilder interface:</p>

      <p>Building a query involves three main steps:</p>

       <ul>
        <li><p>Browsing the model browser to find the classes of data you wish to query.</p></li>
        <li><p>Applying constraints to this data to define the subset of that type of data required</p></li>
        <li><p>Defining your results table by selecting the fields you want to include.</p></li>  

      <p>The main FlyMine QueryBuilder page is composed of several sections:</p>

       <img alt="[querybuilder_overview.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="querybuilder_overview.png"/> 
        

      <ul> <li><p><b>The model browser (top left)</b> allows you to browse
        through the FlyMine data model.  This displays an initial
        starting class and its fields with classes containing related
        information listed below.  Each class can be expanded to show
        the fields for that class and in turn, any classes related to
        that class.  For example, if the starting class is 'Gene', the
        fields shown will include 'name', 'identifier' and 'symbol'
        and the classes of related information include 'Proteins',
        'Transcripts' and 'Microarray results'.  The model browser
        thus allows you to browse through the types of data that are
        available and select those that you wish to query. For each
        field within the model browser there is a 'SHOW' and a
        'CONSTRAIN' option. These are used to either select a field to
        show in the results output or to constrain in the constraints
        list (see below).  </p></li>

       <img alt="[querybuilder_modelbrowser.png ]" class="inlinegraphic" src="querybuilder_modelbrowser.png"/>
     


        <li><p><b>The constraint editor (right)</b> allows you to
      specify the constraints you wish to apply to particular classes
      and fields. A constraint is like a filter - you filter out a
      subset of the objects in a class which have certain
      characteristics (defined by the constraint). To apply a
      constraint to a field, navigate to the field in the model
      browser and click on the 'constrain' button next to it. This
      will bring up a box in the constraint editor allowing you to
      specify your constraint.  You can change the relationship (and,
      or, grouping) between the different constraints using the
      'constraint logic'.  A summary of the constraints that have been
      added is shown in the query summary (top right). </p></li>

      <img alt="[querybuilder_constrain.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="querybuilder_constrain.png"/>
      

        <li><p><b>The output fields list (bottom)</b> displays the
        fields you have selected to show in your results.  (Each field
        is represented by a box which will become a column in the
        results table. Initially, the output fields list will say 'No
        fields selected for output'.  To select a field to show in
        the results output you press 'SHOW' next to the
        field. (Alternatively selecting 'SUMMARY' next to the class
        name will add the main fields for that class to your results
        output). The order of fields in the output fields list can be
        changed by dragging and dropping them. Fields can be deleted
        from the output fields list using the 'x'. Fields that have
        been selected for output will appear in a blue box in the
        model browser and constraint list.  By default results will be
        sorted alphabetically, in ascending order, based on the first
        column.  The column to sort on can be changed by clicking on
        the 'sort' box under the column name - note this changes the
        name of the column displayed under 'Sort Results By Column' .
        The direction of sorting (ascending/descending) can be changed
        by clicking on the box under the field name in this
        section.</p></li>

    </ul>

<h1>3. Altering the results output of a template</h1>


      <p><i>We will first introduce the use of the Query Builder by
      altering a template query. We will start with the template 'For
      the following gene symbol, show its gene identifier' and alter
      it to collect all gene identifiers, symbols and FBgns from genes
      on the 4th chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster.</i></p>

      <p>Find the template 'Gene symbol --> Gene identifier'
        and run the query for the default <i>Drosophila</i> gene.</p>

       <p>Change the query so that it also gives you the FBgn
number:</p>


   <ul><li><p>Click on 'Query' in the trail (near top of results page)
to return to the template query form.  Here, click on 'Edit Query' to
display this query in the Query Builder. - Note that 'identifier' and
'symbol' in the left column have a blue background to indicate that
they are selected for output.</p></li>

  <li><p>To make the FBgn number appear on the result page as well,
click on 'SHOW' next to 'organismDbId' under 'Gene'. 'organismDbId'
will now appear in blue and can be found in the output section
below. The order of the columns can be changed by clicking and
dragging the output boxes.</p></li>

<img alt="[select_organismDbId.png ]" class="inlinegraphic" src="select_organismDbId.png"/>


  <li><p>Scroll down and click 'Show results' to run the query again.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>4. Adding and removing constraints</h1>


      <p>Change the query again to retrieve all genes on the 4th
      chromosome of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>:</p>


   <ul><li><p>Click on 'query' in the trail to return to the Query
   Builder.  The right hand side summarises constraints in the current
   query.  Note the constraint on Gene symbol is 'zen'. Clicking on
   the red cross next to 'symbol' will delete this
   constraint.</p></li>


<img alt="[remove_constraint.png ]" class="inlinegraphic" src="remove_constraint.png"/>  



<p><li>To constrain the current query to <i>Drosophila
melanogaster</i>, click on the '+' sign next to organism in the model
browser. Click on 'CONSTRAIN' next to 'name' (under 'organism'). This
brings up a 'Constrain' section to the right (you might have to scroll
down to view it). Select 'Filter query results on this field having a
specific value' and choose <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> from the
drop-down menu.  Click 'Add to query' next to the drop-down menu.
</p> </li>




<img alt="[add_organismConstraint.png ]" class="inlinegraphic" src="add_organismConstraint.png"/> 



<p><li>Next , constrain the current query for genes on the 4th
chromosome, by clicking on 'CONSTRAIN' next to 'identifier' under
'chromosome'. In the 'Constrain' section to the right, enter a value
for the chromosomal identifier: the identifier for the 4th chromosome
is '4'. Click 'Add to query' next to the drop-down menu.  Scroll
down and click 'Show results' to run the query. </p></li>



</ul>


<p>Re-run the query with the results sorted Z-A on the organismDbId (FBgn)</p>

<h1>5. Building a query from scratch</h1>
 
      <p><i>To build a new query from scratch, access the FlyMine
    QueryBuilder at the bottom FlyMine home page, from the
    QueryBuilder tab in the main menu bar or by choosing a query
    starting point at the bottom of a data category page.</i></p>

    <p>The query builder page allows you to choose a class from which
    to start building a query from scratch. Build your query by adding
    constraints and selecting your results output in the same way as
    already described for altering a template.</p>.

<img alt="[buildfromscratch.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildfromscratch.png"/>


<h1>6. Building a template: start</h1>


      <p><i>Any query that has been built using the FlyMine QueryBuilder
    can be saved as a template query, as long as it includes at least
    one editable constraint. In order to build a template you need to
    be logged-in to FlyMine. Templates that you create yourself are
    saved to your 'MyMine' account.</i></p>

    <p> We will now save the query we made above as a template. First
    make sure you are logged in. Then, scroll down and click on 'Start
    building a template query'.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemplate_start.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemplate_start.png"/>


<h1>7. Building a template: Editable constraints</h1>


      <p>In order to save a query as a template it is necessary to
        define which of the constraints in the query will be editable
        in the template (there must be at least one 'editable'
        constraint in the query). To make a constraint editable within
        a template, click on the lock next to the constraint: A field
        with 'Template constraint settings' will appear in the right
        column. Click in the tick-box next to 'Editable'. At the same
        time, it is possible to add a label to the editable constraint
        (optional) to clarify what it is. Click on the 'Update' button
        in this field. The label will appear on the template page
        after creating the template (see below).</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemplate_edit_r11.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemplate_edit_r11.png"/>

      <p>An editable constraint will have an open lock in the
   constraint list, whereas the lock of a constraint that cannot be
   edited will appear locked. The label of the editable constraint
   will appear below the constraint, in italics.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemplate_label.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemplate_label.png"/>

      <p>If no label was added after a constraint was made editable,
    'no label' will appear under the constraint. Clicking on 'no
    label' allows you to add a label. Click on 'Update' to implement
    the change.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemplate_nolabel.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemplate_nolabel.png"/>

      <p>Make both the organism and the chromosome constraints of this query editable and enter an appropriate label. </p>


<h1>8. Building a template: Name and description</h1>

      <p>Each new template requires a name and a title and an optional
    description. The title and description will appear on the template
    page and in your list of template queries, after creating the
    template (see below). Therefore, they should provide as much
    information as possible about what the template will do. Moreover,
    the title should be distinguishable from other template
    queries. After filling-in the 'Name', 'Title' and 'Description'
    boxes, click on 'Update settings' below the boxes.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemplate_name_r11.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemplate_name_r11.png"/>


<h1>9. Building a template: Previewing and viewing</h1>

      <p>Before creating a template, preview the template and make
    any changes, if necessary. To save this query as a template, click
    on 'Save template'.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemplate_preview.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemplate_preview.png"/>

      <p>You will be able to view and run this template both from the
    templates page and from the 'Saved templates' tab of your 'MyMine'
    account. Access your MyMine page via the tab on the menu bar on
    every FlyMine page.  For each template on your MyMine page there
    are a set of actions, 'Run', 'Edit' and 'Export'. 'Run' will run
    the template query and give you a results page.  'Edit' allows you
    to edit the template query. 'Export' will export the template in
    xml format.  In addition clicking on the star next to a template
    name (so that it turns yellow) will add that template to the
    'Favourite templates' tab of your MyMine.</p>
