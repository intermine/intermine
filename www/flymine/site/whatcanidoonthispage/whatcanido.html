<h1>Templates</h1>
פרט<h2>The basics</h2>

<p> This page shows all public templates, as well as your own (marked with 'my') - if you are logged in. Templates are predefined queries, each has a simple form and a description. Clicking on a template will display the template form allowing you to run or edit the query. We can add templates to this page at any time - it only takes a few
minutes - so if you have a suggestion, let us know.</p> 


<h2>Searching Templates</h2>

<p> You can search templates by keywords (eg gene, orthologue, FlyAtlas). By default, templates from all data categories will be searched. Optionally, you can restrict your search to a certain data type. If you are logged in, public templates as well as your own templates will be searched, by default.</p>

<img alt="[Templates]"  src="templates_search.png"/>

<p>In the example below, only 'My templates' will be searched (not the public ones), and only templates that I have marked as 'My Favourites'.</p>

<h1>Aspect Page</h1>
פרט

<p>The FlyMine website presents the principle data types grouped
together as different 'aspects', such as protein interactions or gene
expression. </p>

<p> Each aspect page lists:</p>

    <p>1. Current data - background information on the origin of particular source datasets:</p>
    <p>2. Bulk download - access to convenient derivative bulk datasets for browsing or export in standard format:</p>

<img alt="[Aspect Page]"  src="aspect_top.png"/>

    <p>3. Relevant predefined template queries:</p>

<img alt="[Aspect Page]"  src="aspect_templates.png"/>


    <p>4. Query starting points - classes for use as starting points in the Query Builder:</p>

<img alt="[Aspect Page]"  src="aspect_querystart.png"/>


<h1>Report Page</h1>
פרט

<p>For every object in the FlyMine database there is a report page
which provides all the data that Flymine has available for that object
along with additional information such as the GBrowse genome viewer
for sequence features.</p>


<p>All report pages have the same basic structure: The top part
provides summary information for every object, whereas the lower part,
'Other details by aspect' has more detailed information divided into
'aspects'. The aspects correspond to categories of data shown on the
FlyMine homepage.</p>

<img alt="[Report Page]"  src="report_top.png"/>

<p> Template queries are run for this gene when the page is loaded. We
can add templates to this page at any time - it only takes a few
minutes - so if you have a suggestion, let us know.  </p>

<h1>Results Page</h1>
פרט<h2>The basics</h2>


<p> The results table for the template 'Gene --> Orthologues + GO
    terms of these orthologues' shows the starting gene, orthologous
    genes and organism names with details of each GO term applied to
    the orthologous genes. Orthologue data in FlyMine come from <a
    href="http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/">InParanoid</a>. Note that
    'main' means the best hit in the other organism, 'secondary'
    denotes paralogues of the best hit.</p>

</p>


<table class="inlinetable">
<tr>

<td padding="5px" valign="center"><img alt="[Result page]" src="results_summary.png"/></td>

<td valign="center" width="60%">

Summary buttons <img alt="[icon]" src="sigma.png" valign="center"/> at
the top of each column allow you to view some summary statistics. For
names and identifiers it will tell you about unique values, numerical
data gives the min, max, mean and standard deviation. The summary
button for the column 'Orthologue > GO annotation > name' shows you
the most commonly occurring GO terms applied to orthologues of the
original gene. (Note: it only shows the first 10 rows of summary).</td> 
</tr> 
</table>

פרט<h2>Export and saving results</h2>

<p> - All results pages have a number of <b>export options</b>:</p>

<p>
<img alt="[Result Page]"  src="export.png"/>
</p>


<p>Currently, either the entire results table or specific columns can be
exported. If nothing is selected, the entire data set will be
exported. If you do not wish to export certain columns these can be
hidden using the small double arrow in the column header.</p>

<p>
<img alt="[Result Page]"  src="results_export.png"/>
</p>

</p> If the results table contains a column with objects that have a
nucleotide or amino acid sequence, it is possible to export all
sequences from that column in FASTA format. Currently, the FASTA
export option will export the sequences belonging to objects in the
first visible (i.e. not hidden) column only. Columns can be moved to
the first position by using the arrows in the header. If objects
appear more than once in the column, the sequence will only be
exported once.</p>


<p> - Results pages also allow you to <b>save your data to a new list or
add them to an existing list</b>:</p>

<p>
<img alt="[Result Page]"  src="save.png"/>
</p>


<p>Select the required data and either add it to an existing list or
save it to a new list. Selecting the check boxes next to the column
headings will select the entire column for saving. Alternatively,
individual items can be saved by selecting check-boxes next to the
items. Currently, a list can only contain one column. However, if you
have multiple columns for the same item (eg a column for gene
identifier and one for gene symbol), all related columns become
highlighted when you select the checkbox next to one. This is because
you are saving the actual item (eg the gene) to a list, not just the
identifier.</p>

<p>
<img alt="[Result Page]"  src="results_list.png"/>
</p>

פרט<h2>Changing the output</h2>

<p>To change the output of the results table, click on 'query' at the top of the results page: </p>

<img alt="[Result Page]" src="results_trail.png"/>.


<p>This will display the template form again, and </p>

<table class="inlinetable">
<tr>

<td padding="5px" valign="center"><img alt="[Template form]" src="editquery.png"/></td>
<td valign="center" width="80%"> will display the template query in the FlyMine Query Builder.</td> 

</tr> 
</table>



<h1>Bag Details Page</h1>


<p>A bag details page provides the following information:</p>
   
<p>1.Bag contents: A table providing information summarising the
contents of your bag. If your bag contains more than ten items, only
the first ten are shown in this table. A button 'View whole bag'
underneath the table allows you to view the entire bag. To the right
of the summary table is a box allowing you to enter a description for
your bag. This is particularly useful if you are logged in and may
come back to use your bag again at a later point.</p>
   
<p>2.Widgets: Widgets provide additional information about the
contents of your bag. Widgets are currently only available for bags of
genes. Widgets giving a summary of gene expression in the adult fly
(according to the FlyAtlas data), a summary of pathways in which any
genes in your bag are involved (according to KEGG) and statistical
anlysis of the GO enrichment of the set of genes in your bag, are
shown where the data is available. The types of data shown through
widgets will increase in future releases of FlyMine.</p>
  
<p>3.Templates: A set of template queries which have been
automatically run on all the items in your bag. </p>



<h1>The Template Form</h1>

<p>As an example, the form is shown for the template 'Gene -->
Orthologues + GO terms of these orthologues'. This template takes a
particular gene as input and searches for orthologues that have GO
annotation.</p>


<p>You can leave the box with the default value shown or you can enter
any identifier and FlyMine will try to find the right gene. For
example, for the <i>D. melanogaster</i> gene zen you can enter 'zen',
'CG1046', 'FBgn0004053', 'zerknullt' or any synonym.  You can even
enter a transcript (CG1046-RA) or protein (ZEN1_DROME) identifier and
FlyMine will convert it for you. Alternatively, you can leave the
default value.</p>

<p>
<img  alt="[Template form]"  src="tem_form.png"/>
</p>

<p><b>OR</b></p> 

<p>Any variable (box) in a template query can be constrained to a bag
(or 'not in' a bag) rather than to a single value, provided you have a
bag of the correct type saved in 'MyMine'. To constrain a query to a
bag, select the checkbox underneath the variable box and choose the
bag from the drop-down list.</p>
