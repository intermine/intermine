<div class="heading2">FlyMine version 8.0 - release notes (27th June 2007)</div>
<div class="body">
<p style="">
      In release 8.0 we have updated the data model for protein interactions, protein structure and orthologues to make them easier and faster to query.  We also include three new data sets: Tiffin (predicted regulatory motifs), anoEST (A. gambiae EST clusters) and predicted 3-D protein structures for A. gambiae domains. A new type of constraint is used in template queries which now allows you to enter any identifier or symbol.
    </p>
<ul>
      <li>
        Data<br />
        <ul>
    <li>NEW - D. melanogaster predicted regulatory motifs and functional sites (motif instances) from the <a href="http://servlet.sanger.ac.uk/tiffin/">Tiffin database</a>. Note these have been mapped to the release 5.0 genome sequence.<br />
</li>
    <li>NEW - A. gambiae EST and EST clusters from the <a href="http://agambiae.vectorbase.org/SequenceData/EST">Imperial College London Centre for Bioinformatics</a>.<br />
</li>
    <li>NEW - A. gambiae protein domain 3-D structure predictions from <a href="http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~kenji/NEW/index.htm">Kenji Mizuguchi</a>.  This data provides structure predictions for regions of A. gambiae proteins that correspond to a Pfam domain.    <br />
</li>
    <li>NEW - H. sapiens and M. musculus protein information included from UniProt, we already include InParanoid orthologues to these organisms.<br />
</li>
       </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        User Interface<br />
        <ul>
    <li>NEW - LOOKUP constraints.  Most template queries are now updated to use a new type of constraint.  Now you don't need to enter a specific type of identifier - for example for the D. melanogaster gene zen you could enter 'zen', 'CG1046', 'FBgn0004053' or 'zerknullt' and get the same result.  You could even enter a protein and or transcript identifier and it would find the gene.<br />

<div class="heading2">FlyMine version 7.1 - release notes (10th May 2007)</div>
<div class="body">
<p style="">
      Release 7.1 includes a number of new user interface features.  Results of queries can be ordered by a selected column and results tables have a new summary button which brings up statistics on the values in that column.  Many template queries now have more descriptive column titles in results tables.
    </p>
<ul>
      <li>
        User Interface<br />
        <ul>
    <li>NEW - Column summaries in results tables.  Each column of a results table now has a summary icon, clicking this will bring up a box with more information about data in the column.  For numerical data it will show the minimum value, maximum value, mean and standard deviation.  For text it will display the number of unique values and the most commonly occuring values with their frequency.<br />
</li>
    <li>NEW - Sorting query results.  The QueryBuilder allows you to select an element from the output to sort results by.  A sort button lets you choose ascending or descending order, for example to display results with the highest confience score or most recent publication first.<br />
</li>
    <li>NEW - Results column titles.  Many template queries are now configured to have more descriptive column headings in results tables.  The full path can be seen by hovering the mouse pointer over the description.<br />
</li>
    <li>NEW - Chromosome distribution viewer. The gene details page for <i>D. melanogaster</i> and <i>A. gambiae</i> now includes a chromosome distribution viewer.  This shows how many genes from the bag are found on each chromosome, click on a bar to see a list of the genes.  The graph also shows an expected number of genes for each chromosome based on the distribution of all genes between chromosomes and the size of the bag.<br />
</li>
    <li>NEW - Accurate counts on the results page.  The results page used to show only an approximate number of rows returned from a query (unless the 'Last' link was clicked).  The estimate is now updated to give an accurate 'Total rows' figure once it has been calculated. <br />
</li>
    <li>UPDATE - The trail (e.g. Query -&gt; Results -&gt; Gene -&gt; Protein) is now more complete to allow easy navigation back to recently viewed queries, results, object details or bag pages.<br />
</li>
    <li>FIX - Performace has been improved when saving and viewing large bags of objects.<br />
</li>
    <li>FIX - Renaming bags now works correctly. <br />
</li>
    <li>FIX - Missing export options from results pages have been fixed.  Genome features can be exported as FASTA or GFF3, protein interactions can be exported in Cytoscape SIF format.<br />
</li>
    <li>FIX - Sequences from Translation objects can now be exported as FASTA.<br />
</li>
    <li>FIX - Some minor issues with display on Internet Explorer have been fixed..<br />

<div class="heading2">FlyMine version 6.1 - release notes (15th February 2007)</div>
<div class="body">
<p style="">
FlyMine 6.1 contains a major overhaul of the way bags are handled.  Bags can now only contain actual objects rather than identifiers or symbols.  This means that any object in a bag has already been found in FlyMine which should reduce confusion.  A sophisticated bag upload system has been added to aid in creating bags from external lists of identifiers.
    </p>
<p style="">
PLEASE NOTE - most saved user content is automatically upgraded between FlyMine releases.  In this case it was not possible to port some types of bags.  These are still available in the 6.0 archive, please contact support@flymine.org if you have any queries about transferring bags.
    </p>
<p style="">
Bags also now have a type (class) assigned to them - for example Gene, Protein, GOTerm.  This means that when editing a constraint in a template query only bags of the correct type will be listed - so if the template requires you to enter a Gene identifier the bags dropdown will list any Gene bags in your profile.    The same is true when creating/editing a query in the QueryBuilder, just add a constraint on the identifier, name, etc of a class and you will see available bags.
    </p>
<p style="">
The 'Bags' page in MyMine (select 'Bags' or 'MyMine' from the top menu bar) now allows you to paste in a list of identifiers and select a type for the new bag.  The input can be a mixture of different identifier types, for example if you wish to create a bag of <i>Drosophila</i> genes if can be a mixture of CGxx, FBgnxx and symbols.  In the case where an object can't be found to that matches a particular input identifier, FlyMine will attempt to help.  For example if the input list contains a UniProt protein identifier, but you choose to make a gene bag, the website will attempt to find a related gene.  Any matches found in this way will be reported for you to choose which are added to your bag.
    </p>
<p style="">
As an example, when creating a Gene bag from these identifiers:  zen CG2328 FBgn0015379 Q8IML9_DROME unknown_name FlyMine will find a gene for each of the first three identifiers and find the gene for the Q8IML9_DROME protein.  The "unknown_name" will be reported as not found.
    </p>
<p style="">
Also new are bag details pages.  These are accessible for any of your saved bags in the 'Bags' tab of MyMine.  They have a similar layout to object details pages but run templates for all objects in your page.  On the page for gene bags is the first of many 'widgets' we plan to add for a viewing and analysis of data in bags.  Currently there a widget that graphs the genes from a bag that are over/under expressed in different tissues according to the FlyAtlas data set (www.flyatlas.org).  Note that clicking on any of the bars in this graph allows you to create a new bag of genes in that category.  More functionality will be available on these pages in release 7.0/

<div class="heading2">FlyMine version 6.0 - release notes (24th November 2006)</div>
<div class="body">
<p style="">FlyMine 6.0 adds data from seven <i>Dropsophila</i> RNAi screens from the DRSC,
          microarray-based gene expression data from FlyAtlas and Transcriptional cis-regulatory modules 
          (CRMs) from REDfly.  Template queries have a new, succinct naming scheme and identifiers/names
          in results tables are now links to object details pages.  Other data sources have been
          updated/added and there are numerous interface improvements.</p>
<p style="">
NOTE - from release 6.0 FlyMine does not support saved bags of objects.  User's object bags have not been ported to release 6.0 but can still be retrieved from the release 5.0 archive.  If any user wishes to use information from old object bags we recommend exporting from 5.0 as a list of appropriate identifiers and uploading to release 6.0.  Please contact us if you require any help with this.   All other saved information has been transferred to release 6.0.
    </p>
<p style="">
   An upcoming release of FlyMine will introduce a new system for uploading and managing bags of data.

        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Data - fixes<br />
         <ul>
          <li>FIX: Gene.name is now Gene.symbol, added Gene.name which has a longer text name.<br />
</li>
          <li>FIX: Transcript.exonCount is now set for all Transcripts.<br />
</li>
          <li>FIX: Only RepeatRegions predicted by TRF are retrieved for <i>A. gambiae</i> from Ensembl.<br />
</li>
          <li>FIX: There are no longer links to UniProt with BDGP identifiers.<br />
</li>
          <li>FIX: Incorrect start and end fields removed from RepeatRegion.<br />
</li>
          <li>FIX: Removed duplicate synonyms for some Proteins.<br />
</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Data - known issues<br />
         <ul>
           <li>Five genes are annotated incorrectly in the FlyBase release 4.2 annotation. These are eys, Dimp, cp309, Nev3 and kay. It is a known problem with FlyBase and a fix is progress. In FlyMine the symbols(names) are modified so that they are unique and indicate that there is a problem. Examples are: Dimp-duplicate-symbol-1, Dimp-duplicate-symbol-2 instead of Dimp.<br />
</li>
           <li>The latest version of InterPro (11.0) is not yet available as a mysql dump so we still have version 10.0.<br />
</li>
           <li>INDAC microarray oligos were designed to FlyBase version 4.0 transcripts. This means a number now map to old transcripts. These oligos can be queried in FlyMine, however the transcript they are designed to will not have merged with a Gene.<br />
</li>
           <li>A number of proteins from Uniprot have not merged with FlyBase genes.  This means that for certain genes there are two objects - one from Uniprot with no other information.<br />
</li>
           <li>Orthologues for <i>A. gambiae</i> did not load.<br />
</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Interface - new features<br />
        <ul>
          <li>NEW: The start page of FlyMine now has links to a series of 'aspects' which are convenient starting points for the different types of data in FlyMine - such as genomics, protein interactions and gene expression. Each aspect lists relevant data sets in FlyMine, template queries and suggested starting points for queries.<br />
</li>
          <li>NEW: Template search box added to the front page.<br />
</li>
          <li>NEW: User templates are now listed on the user's History page.<br />
</li>
          <li>NEW: Saved bags and saved queries can be renamed from the History page.<br />
</li>
          <li>NEW: Executed queries are now automatically saved to a 'session history'. The user can permanently save a query from the session history from the History page.<br />
</li>
          <li>NEW: Saved queries and queries in the session history are now displayed with the date and time at which they were created.<br />
</li>
          <li>NEW: Saved queries and queries in the session history are now displayed with their starting point and a summary of the fields selected for output.<br />
</li>
          <li>NEW: You can now edit an existing constraint in the query builder by clicking the blue edit icon next to the constraint.<br />
</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Interface - fixes<br />
