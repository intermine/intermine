פרט<h2>1. What is FlyMine?</h2>


<p>FlyMine is a data warehouse that integrates many diverse biological data sets.
The main focus is <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Anopheles</i> genomics and proteomics.
By integrating such data into one place it is possible to construct queries across
domains of biological knowledge.</p>



<table class="inlinetable">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="60%">
<b>See a list of all the data sources from the FlyMine home page:</b>

<td padding="5px" valign="top">

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The FlyMine user interface is designed to go beyond simply looking
up an identifier and viewing a report page.  This quick tour will
introduce some of the features:</p>

<p><b>Quick Search</b> is available just like on other sites, type in
an identifier to see a report page.</p>

<p><b>Template queries</b> are 'canned' queries that provide a simple
form to perform a specific task.</p>

<p><b>Bags</b> let you operate on whole lists of data at once.  You can
upload your own lists or save them from results tables.<p>

<p><b>The QueryBuilder</b> lets you create your own custom queries and
edit existing templates.</p>

<p><b>Aspects</b> are a way to explore the data and template queries
for a particular area of biology - for example Comparative Genomics or
Protein Interactions.</p>

<p><b>MyMine</b> lets you create an account to save your own queries
and bags.</p>


<h2>2. Report Pages</h2>

<p>A quick search box appears on the front page and in the menu bar of all pages.  You can search for any identifier or symbol for genes, proteins, transcripts and so on.  You can use '*' as a wildcard.</p>

<p><b>Run a quick search for the Drosophila gene 'eve'.</b></p>

<img alt="[Quick Search]" src="quick_search.png"/>

<p>
The report page shows information from many data sources in one place.  There are corresponding pages for all objects in FlyMine, use <img alt="[details...]" align="middle" src="details.png"/> links to browse.
</p>

<img alt="[object details summary]"  src="object_details_summary.png"/>

<p>
Template queries are run for this gene when the page is loaded.  We can add templates to this page at any time - it only takes a few minutes - so if you have a suggestion, let us know.
</p>

<img alt="[object details templates]"  src="object_details_templates.png"/>


<h2>3. Template Queries</h2>

<p>
FlyMine includes a library of <b>template queries</b> - predefined queries designed to perform a particular task.  Each one has a description and a form to fill in.  For example, there are templates to find GO annotation for a gene, to retrieve protein-protein interactions or protein structures.</p>

<p>
You can find lists of template queries on each aspect page.
</p>

<img alt="[Aspects]"  src="aspects.png"/>

<p>
Or use the 'Search templates' menu link that searches the titles and descriptions.
</p>

<img alt="[Click Search Templates]"  src="click_search_templates.png"/>

<p><b>Search templates for 'orthologue' and select the template 'Gene --> Orthologues + GO terms of these orthologues'</b></p>

<img alt="[Select template]"  src="select_template1.png"/>


<h2>4. Run a template</h2>

<p>The template we found in our previous search takes a particular gene as input and searches for orthologues that have GO annotation.</p>


<p>You can enter any identifier and FlyMine will try to find the right gene.</p>

<p>For example, for the the <i>D. melanogaster</i> gene zen you can enter 'zen', 'CG1046', 'FBgn0004053', 'zerknullt' or any synonym.  You can even enter a transcript (CG1046-RA) or protein (ZEN1_DROME) identifier and FlyMine will convert it for you.</p>

<p><b>Click 'Show Results' to run this template with the default value.</b></p>

<p>
<img alt="[Template form]"  src="template_form.png"/>
</p>

<h2>5. Results page</h2>

<p>
The results table shows the starting gene, orthologous genes and organism names with details of each GO term applied to the orthologous genes.  Orthologue data in FlyMine comes from <a href="http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/">InParanoid</a>, note that 'main' means the best hit in the other organism, 'secondary' denotes paralogues of the best hit.
</p>

<img alt="[Results table]"  src="results.png"/>

<p>
Summary buttons <img alt="[icon]"  src="summary_maths.png" valign="center"/> at the top of each column allow you to view some summary statistics.  For names and identifiers it will tell you about unique values, numerical data gives the min, max, mean and standard deviation.
</p>

<p><b>Click the summary button for the column 'Orthologue > GO annotation > name'</b></p>

<p>
The table shows the most commonly occurring GO terms applied to orthologues of the original gene.
</p>

<img alt="[Summary table]"  src="summary_table.png"/>

<p>
All results pages have a number of export options.
</p>

<img alt="[Export]"  src="export.png"/>


<h2>6. Query Builder</h2>

<p>The QueryBuilder allows you to edit queries or create new ones.  It is aimed at advanced users but editing a template query to change the output or add a filter is easy.</p>

<p><b>Click on 'Query' in the Trail to get back to the template form.</b></p>

<img alt="[Click on trail]"  src="click_on_trail.png"/>

<p><b>Now click 'Edit Query' to bring up the QueryBuilder.</b></p>

<p><img alt="[Click edit query]"  src="click_edit_query.png"/></p>


<p>The pane on the left is a view of the data model starting at the class gene and showing all attributes (e.g. name, symbol) and related classes (e.g. organism, proteins).  FlyMine uses an object based data model - biological types are termed 'classes' and individual entries are termed 'objects'.  For example the 'zen' and 'eve' genes are both objects of the class Gene.</p>

<p>You can click to open related classes and see their attributes.  The <img alt="[show]"  src="show.gif"/> and <img alt="[constrain]"  src="constrain.gif"/> buttons let you add fields to the output of a query and add contraints (filters). </p> 

<img alt="[query builder]"  src="query_builder.png"/>

<p><b>Scroll to the bottom of the page to see the output list of this query.</b></p>

<p><b>Click the <img alt="[red cross]"  src="cross.gif"/> buttons to remove the last three columns from the query - the three that mention GO annotation.</b></p>

<img alt="[remove columns]"  src="remove_columns.png"/>

<p><b>Click 'Show results' to run the query.</b></p>

<img alt="[click show results]"  src="click_show_results.png"/>

<p>Now we have run the query to show orthologues of the starting gene whether they have GO annotation or not.  Now if you click the <img alt="[summary icon]"  src="summary_maths.png" valign="center"/> button for the column 'Othologue > organism > shortName' it will show you how many orthologues there are in each organism.</p>


<h2>7. Bag Upload</h2>

<p>FlyMine can operate on custom lists of data, we call them <b>bags</b>.  You can save bags from results pages or create them by uploading lists of identifiers.  Bags can be used when running template queries and analysed by a series of <b>widgets</b> on a bag details page.  You can also perform set operations on bags.</p>
</p>

<p>
<i>Coming soon - we will create globally available bags with, for example, lists of genes identified in a particular paper.</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Click on 'bags' in the top menu bar to get to the bag upload page.</b>
</p>

<img alt="[Click bags in the menu bar]"  src="click_bags.png"/>

<p>
FlyMine's bag creation tool helps you upload a list of identifiers, the list can contain a mix of identifier types.</p>

<p><b>Now upload the example bag:</b></p>

<img alt="[Create a new bag]"  src="create_a_bag.png"/>


<h2>7. Bag confirm page</h2>

<p>
If some identifiers don't produce an exact match a confirmation page lets you resolve any issues.  Here, two genes were found by synonyms and a protein identifier has been converted to the corresponding gene.  You can check through each issue or just add all the matches to your bag.
</p>

<p><b>Click 'Add all' to include all suggested genes to the bag.</b></p>

<img alt="[Add these bag]"  src="bag_confirm_add.png"/>

<p><b>Choose a name for your bag and save it.</b></p>

<img alt="[Save bag]"  src="bag_confirm_save.png"/>


<h2>8. Bag details page</h2>

<p>
The bag details is a great way to find out more about a list of genes.  A number of 'widgets' display graphs and tables to summarise the contents.  These are interactive - click to see lists of genes in each catergory,
</p>

<p><i>Coming soon - we plan to add more widgets and functionality to the bag details page.</i></p>


<p>The GO enrichment and KEGG widgets suggest that this list of genes contains a high number of transcription factors.</p>

<img alt="[Bag widgets]"  src="bag_widgets.png"/>

<p>
Template queries have been executed on the whole bag, just like on the gene report page.  This is a simple way to retrieve further information about the entire list.  For example, you could retrieve all the exons or protein sequences.
</p>

<img alt="[Bag templates]"  src="bag_templates.png"/>

<h2>9. Use bags in template queries</h2>

<p>
You can use bags in any template query or queries you create yourelf in the QueryBuilder.  As the bag details page suggested many of the genes in our bag are transcription factors we can run a template to find the genes they regulate.  FlyMine includes FlyReg - a curated DNAse 1 binding site data set which we can query with another template. 
</p>

<p><b>Search the template queries for 'regulated genes'.</b></p>

<img alt="[Click Search Templates]"  src="click_search_templates.png"/>

<p><b>Select the template 'Transcription factor --> TF binding sites + chromosomal locations + genes regulated'</b></p>

<img alt="[Select template]"  src="select_template2.png"/>

<p>Now that we have created a bag the template query gives us the option to use it instead of entering and identifier.</p>

<p><b>Click the checkbox to select our demo bag and run the query.</b></p>

<img alt="[Run template with bag]"  src="template_bag.png"/>

<p>The results table shows any genes from our original bag that, according to FlyReg, regulate a particular gene.</p>

<p>You can also create new bags from results tables.  We can save a bag of the regulated genes from this query to look at the bag details page or use it in more templates.</p>

<p><b>Click on the checkbox by 'Regulated gene > identifier' and choose a name for the saved bag.</b></p>

<img alt="[Save column in a bag]"  src="results_bag.png"/>
<br/>
<img alt="[Save in a bag]"  src="save_in_bag.png"/>


<p>Using bags is an excellent way to retrieve information about a whole list of data. For example we could also retrieve:
<ul>
<li>all the orthologues in another organsim, e.g. <i>D. pseuedoobscura</i></li>
<li>gene expression results from FlyAtlas</li>
<li>protein-protein interactions for these genes</li>
<li>and P-element insertions that overlap these genes</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>10. MyMine</h2>

<p>The bags that we have created will be saved temporarily for our current session.  To save them permanently in FlyMine you can create a MyMine account.</p>

<img alt="[Click log in]"  src="click_login.png"/>

 <p>In MyMine you can save bags and queries you create in the QueryBuilder.  You can even use the QueryBuilder to turn a new query into a template of your own.</p>
