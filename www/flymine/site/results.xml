      <heading>The result display</heading>
      <item>
        The results page displays the first 10 objects returned by your query.
      </item>
      <item>
        The number of objects displayed can be changed by changing the number
        in the Page size box and pressing Change.
      </item>
      <item>
        You can scroll though the objects using Next, or go to the last
        objects using Last.
      </item>
      <item>
        The total number of objects returned by your query is estimated. An
        estimate is given because, for large queries, only a subset of the
        total number of objects is initially returned by the query.  This is
        to improve query run time for large queries.

      <heading>Saved Queries</heading>
      <item>
        All queries run are saved in the query history.  If you do not give
        your query a particular name (in the 'Save query' box at the bottom of
        the query interface), it will be saved as query_x (where x increments
        for each query run).  The name given to your current query is
        displayed at the top of the results page.
      </item>
      <item>
        To access your query history, click on History in the menu bar.  Here
        you can select a query to run again or modify in the query builder
        interface. You can also delete any queries you no longer wish to keep.
      </item>

    <section>
      <heading>Saving bags of data</heading>
      <item>
        Data can be saved into 'bags' and stored in your query history.  To
        save your data to a bag select the required data and either add it to
        an existing bag or save it to a new bag. Selecting the checkboxes next
        to the column headings will select the entire column for export.
        Alternativly, individual items can be saved by selecting checkboxes
        next to the items. Saved bags of data can be viewed from the History
        page (accessable form the menu bar).
      </item>
      <item>
        Saved bags of data can be used to constrain new queries.  If you have
        saved bags of data these will become available for constraining
        queries in the constaint list of the query builder page.
      </item>
    </section>

    <section>
      <heading>Exporting Data</heading>
      <item>
        Data can be exported from the results page in various formats -
        currently Excel format, comma separated values or tab separated
        values.  The entire data set will be exported - you do not need to
        select any checkboxes. If you do not wish to export certain columns
        these can be hidden using the 'hide' option in the column header.
